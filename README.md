# Herp Fortress

This is an archived copy of the source code of Herp Fortress written by Minecraft's original developer, Markus "Notch" Persson, based on [the Internet Archive version](https://web.archive.org/web/20120601154736/0x10c.com/tmp/HerpFortress.zip), with only one code fix which causes the Java compiler to fail, the rest is unaffected.

I am not the owner of this code, i'm just reuploading.
